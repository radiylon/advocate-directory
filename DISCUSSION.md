# TODO

## UI
- Add missing loading UI
- Add missing error UI
- Add an Advocate profile photo
- Find a way to improve displaying specialties and providing users a way to navigate them
- Add improved filtering UX for experience, city, degree, specialty instead of text search
- Pre-fetch queries on-hover for speed
- Consider if SSR is appropriate
- More accent colors aka less green
- UX that allows users to click on advocate, leads to detail/booking page

## DB
- Missing indexes in schema
- Swap `payload` field to `specialties` field
- Need more advocate data to display on the screen
- Improve seed script to include more data so we can test production loads (ex. 100k+ records)

## General
- Tests
